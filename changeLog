5/15/2012
 - Event Action:

   Limiting loop on NGENP option number of generated particle.
   This should speed up considerably the simulation in case of high luminosity beams.

 - A new factory has been introduced: "parameters".
   This factory stores the geometry parameters and make them available to the reconstruction routines.
   This factory currently support MYSQL.

   Inside each hit process routine, parameters can now be accessed with the "gpars" map,
   using the detector name and parameter name. For example::

    gpars["BST/nregions"] is equal to 4

4/9/2012
 - Added Mirrors in the hit definition list
 - Added sensitive detector: "Mirrors" with FLUX associated hit process routine.
   This will allow mirrors to use identifiers w/o recording the unnecessary hits on them.

   By default it will not record the particles hitting it.
   To record, use the option::

    -RECORD_MIRRORS=1

4/6/2012
 - added validation scripts to test compilation, running, geometry, etc
 - correcting cpp material factory: molecules can (and should) be formed by molecular components not fractional masses

4/5/2012
 - Migrating from custome element definitions to G4 Material database, both in CPP and MYSQL material factory.
   MYSQL factory finalized with:

   * custom elements

4/3/2012
 - added scripts to upload materials to DB
 - added explicit units for molar mass (g/mol)
 - Added elements file, perl scripts to upload elements materials in mysql DB
 - (Puckett) With this update, HTCC_hitprocess looks for the property "EFFICIENCY" to be defined for the
   material of the detector; e.g., a PMT photocathode. If it is found, then each optical photon
   is detected with probability corresponding to the efficiency. If the property "EFFICIENCY"
   has not been defined for the material of this sensitive detector, then all optical photons are detected.
 - (Puckett) In the processing of mirror definitions, I added the capability to use the optical properties
   of a pre-existing material instead of properties defined in the detector identifiers. This allows more
   flexible (wavelength-dependent) optical properties to be used for mirror surfaces. To use this functionality,
   the detector identifiers must contain: "WithMaterial: [material name] dummy" where [material name]
   is the name of a pre-existing material with defined optical properties and dummy is the integer "id"
   required to read in the "identifiers" line from the database. In this context "id" is a dummy variable
   that has no effect, but must be included or the database io will fail.
 - Added Materials factories: MYSQL, CPP, GDML


3/30/2012
 - added material factory to load materials from cpp_file, databases, gdml file

7/19/2011
 - **signal interface**
   For now it will display the single step informations for each hit, and graphs of energy deposited.

   In the future it will display the signal in volt versus time.

   By default the tracks passing through a material without depositing any energy will not be recored.
   The flag RECORD_PASSBY can be set to 1 if you want to record these.

 - Corrected "about" page.


6/14/2011
 - improved magnetic field log

 - In SteppingAction: kill optical photons generated in semimirror (or they reflect forever because of refraction indexes)
 - In StepngAction: kill tracks that do not change position after 10 steps
 - By default gemc will not save the mother particle vertex and pid infos anymore.
   This will allow to:
   1.  not store all the trajectories in memory, which is a huge overload
   2.  not go through all the trajectories in MEventAction, which saves a lot of processing time
   The infos can still be saved with the option::

    -SAVE_ALL_MOTHERS=1

5/9/2011
 - RICH hit process routine (Ahmed, Argonne)
 - Added right click menu to write out GDML file for selected detector.

 - Adding Material "Kryptonite" - anything passing through it will be killed.

2/11/2011
 - PID, Vertex, Charge is set on MSensitive detector instead of MEvent Action.
   This should save some memory at the end of the event.

2/9/2011

 - ProcessHitRoutine was not deleted inside the sensitive detector loop
 - Removed unnecessary evioDOMNode::createEvioDOMNode(1,  1) (this fixed another leak)
 - Added DEFAULT_MATERIAL flag. If a material is not defined, the code will stop unless this flag is set to some existing material.
   In that case any undefined material will be set to DEFAULT_MATERIAL.
 - Removed unnecessary tmp file in RICH detector.

11/30/2010
 - Passing pointer of function map instead of copying it.
 - Adding warning if map element doesn't exists.

11/17/2010
 - Added option::

   -SCALE_FIELD

  to scale at run time a particular magnetic field by a factor.

   Example to activate both hit process lists::

    -HIT_PROCESS_LIST="clas12 aprime"

11/15/2010
 - Deleting ProcessHit pointers (making it also a class member) when not used.
   This doesn't get rid of all memory leaks but it limits them.
   More memory leaks are coming from copy constructors it seems.

11/13/2010
 - Preparing to accept multiple experiment hit processes.


10/29/2010
 - Changed the slider upper limit for momentum from 11 GeV to 20 GeV

10/15/2010
 - Implemented options to connect to MYSQL server with different usernames and passwords
 - Added command line options for MySQL username and password DBUSER and DBPSWD

10/2/2010
 - Set the maximum tracking step in the magnetic field to 1mm. Without this the trajectories of the
   charged particle in the vacuum in presence of a B-field seem to be very rugged. Looks smoother with 1mm limit.

9/28/2010
 - Added a possibility to switch the order of the rotation and translation when operating on
   two volumes when using Operation keyword in the geometry database.
   It turned out that the rotation is always performed with the resect to the
   axis of the first volume, so the two transformations do not commute.


9/20/2010
 - Minor: Removing some compiler warnings

 - gemc now keeps the following infos for **each step** in MHit (as opposed to the first step only)

   * pid
   * mother pid
   * track id
   * mother track id
   * vert
   * mother vert

   in addition to the other quantities.

 - The function to get the vector<int> trackID has changed name to GetTIds to make it consistent with all the other names


8/10/2010
 - Introducing mirrors to gemc.
   The mirrors reflect optical photons with the usual fresnel equations.

   To declare a volume "A" as mirror, the identifier must be set to::

    Mirror:  <volume of surface>  <reflectivity index>

   where the <volume of surface> is the name of the volume that borders with volume "A" and the reflectivity is a int number
   percentage, from 0 to 100, 100 being completely reflective.

   This is tested for the HTCC ellipsoid mirrors.


7/30/2010

7/9/2010
 - Added OpenGL QT Stored mode.
   Graphic options USE_QT are now:

   * 0:  Don't use the graphical interface
   * 1:  QT OpenGL Immediate mode (can interact with picture; sliders works well; slower than Stored mode)
   * 2:  OpenGL Stored mode (can't interact with picture; sliders works well)
   * 3:  OpenGL Immediate mode (can't interact with picture; sliders works well; slower than Stored mode)
   * 4:  QT OpenGL Stored mode (can interact with picture; sliders works but picture needs to be updated by clicking on it)



7/8/2010
 - Removing from Sensitive Detector Routine and adding to Event Action:

   * PID, vertex info
   * Mother particle (this also fixes a bug): PID, vertex info
 - Adding charge of the track in each step in MHit, retrievable with GetCharges (vector)
   and GetCharge (int).


6/15/2010
 - Do not check for ID=0 if identifier type is "manual" - By Maurik Holtrop.

6/9/2010

3/10/2010
 - Added Detector infos for each step.

3/9/2010
 - Added "Tesla" and "m" units for magnetic field definitions.

3/8/2010
 - Multiple detectors can be associated with the same identifier.

   - Example: in the EC, all layers in INNER and OUTER are summed together.
   - The "detector" information is then saved in the MHit class for each step in order not to
     lose the original volume information.
   - This is transparent to all users - GetDetector will still return the first volume hit (as before).
   - The new function GetDetectors will return the whole vector<detector>

3/2/2010

    But one silicon module can contain many read-out strip: in this case
    one element is the single strip.

    The process of element identification is done at the HitProcess level.

    In the main gemc model, all energies deposited in one element for each step
    add, all positiions average, etc.

	 - Option LUMI_P: Luminosity Beam particle, momentum, angles (in respect of z-axis).
	   Example: -LUMI_P="proton, 1*GeV, 25*deg, 2*deg" sets luminosity beam 1 GeV protons 25 degrees in theta, 2 degrees in phi.
	   Use -LUMI_P="show_all" to print the list of G4 supported particles.
