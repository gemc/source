- Making sure the numeric conditions on reading maps is the en_US
some other country may interpret the dot or commas differently (e.g. 1.0 is 1,0 in some country)

11/3/15

  The number of events is randomized based on the number of events desired by the user and the weight table.
- improved ftof digitization routines

5/20/15
- added active fields in the option map so they are written in the output (as simulation conditions)

4/21/15
- added scintillation in the material definition, both in API and in the gemc core.
  The number of photons emitted has two component (fast and slow) and is proportional two:

       A e^(-t/tfast) + B e ^(-t/tslow)

  where A and B are the fast and slow component respectively and are dependent on wavelength,
  and tfast and tslow are the fast and slow time constant (valid for all wavelengths).

  The following quantities can now be specified in the material API, and will be read by gemc.

   * fastcomponent: vector (wavelength)
   * slowcomponent: vector (wavelength)
   * scintillationyield: number of photons / MeV
   * resolutionscale: scale to control the resolution (multiplies sqrt(N))
   * fasttimeconstant: fast time constant
