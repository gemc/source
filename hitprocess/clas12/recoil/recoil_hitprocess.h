/// \class recoil_HitProcess
/// <b> FMT_HitProcess </b>\n\n
/// The forward micromegas hit process routine includes:\n
/// - conversion of the deposited energy into a number of electrons: the deposited energy provided by Geant4 is
/// used to estimate the average number of electrons created in the MM sensitive volume (knowing the mean
/// ionization potential of the gas). If the deposited energy is smaller than the ionization potential
/// (roughly 25 eV), then the hit is discarded
/// - generation of a transverse diffusion: for each electron created at the previous step, a transverse
/// diffusion is generated on a Gaussian. The width of this Gaussian is obtained by the standard formula for
/// diffusion, i.e. proportional to the square root of the distance between the interaction point and the micro-mesh.
/// Because of the focusing magnetic field, the amplitude of the transverse diffusion is considerably reduced
/// compared to the BMT.
/// - determination of the strip: the final transverse position of each electron (after transverse diffusion)
/// is converted into a strip number (the closest one).
/// - determination of the energy collected on the closest strip: if N electrons have been created for the
/// deposited energy Edep, the energy associated to the current strip is Edep/N. Note that this assumes no
/// gain fluctuation. A more realistic treatment (not yet implemented) would be to generate a gain for each
/// electron, using a Polya distribution.
/// - check of the acceptance: if the strip number is negative or larger than the total number of strips,
/// it is discarded (associated value is -1).
