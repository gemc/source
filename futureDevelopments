GEMC Future Development

Wanted features:
================

- add magnetic field lines: /vis/scene/add/magneticField 5
(doesn't work for both fields why)

- make detector factories external plugins

- rastering option with g4 volumes movements

Code Improvements:
==================

- physics details choices (disable some physics, etc on the GUI)
- "ahit" general function to get infos (with auto, c++11) getVector(string), get3Vector(string)
   check performance hit
- speed up the search for same identifier
- add generic "system" that contains a list detectors, sensitive det, materials?
- optimize eventaction - too many vector<hitOutput> definitions? Can they br grouped?
- add DEBUG ifdefs for debugging part of code
- get screen resolution and adjust gui dimensions to that
- add /tracking/storeTrajectory 4 button
- add track verbosity output
- is atof thread safe?
- move all user actions in their directory:
  ActionInitialization
  PrimaryGenerator
  SteppingAction
- gemcOptions make it a library, pass it by reference not value!
- make calls like gemcOpt->get3Vector("BEAM_V")
- change primaryFlat to thetaGauss thetaUniform cthetaGauss cthetaUniform.
- add system name to material name
- sqlite support. Dropdown menu: available systems.



Fixes
=====

Log of load path should be corrected /group still show /group even though the detector is loaded
from a different path using the GEMC_DIR variable
